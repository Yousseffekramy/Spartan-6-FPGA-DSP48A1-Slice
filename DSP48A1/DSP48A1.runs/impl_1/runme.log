ERROR: [DRC NSTD-1] Unspecified I/O Standard: 326 out of 327 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].

WARNING: [DRC CFGBVS-7] CONFIG_VOLTAGE with Config Bank VCCO: The CONFIG_MODE property of current_design specifies a configuration mode (SPIx4) that uses pins in bank 14.  I/O standards used in this bank have a voltage requirement of 1.80.  However, the CONFIG_VOLTAGE for current_design is set to 3.3.  Ensure that your configuration voltage is compatible with the I/O standards in banks used by your configuration mode.  Refer to device configuration user guide for more information.    Pins used by config mode: V28 (IO_L1P_T0_D00_MOSI_14), V29 (IO_L1N_T0_D01_DIN_14), V26 (IO_L2P_T0_D02_14), V27 (IO_L2N_T0_D03_14), W26 (IO_L3P_T0_DQS_PUDC_B_14), and Y27 (IO_L6P_T0_FCS_B_14)
WARNING: [DRC DPOP-2] MREG Output pipelining: DSP in_M/in_r_reg multiplier stage in_M/in_r_reg/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
